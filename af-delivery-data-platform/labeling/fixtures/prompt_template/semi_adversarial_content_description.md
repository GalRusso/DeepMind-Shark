Adversary Level Name:
    Semi-Adversarial

Adversary Level Definition:
    Content that is ambiguous, emotionally charged, or symbolically suggestive, and carries an elevated risk of adversarial misuse. While it may not contain explicitly violative elements, its tone, context, or visual implication introduces a manipulation vector - allowing it to be reframed or interpreted in ways that edge toward policy violations.

    This level of content often walks the line: it does not clearly cross a threshold, but presents a significant potential to be weaponized in downstream outputs, prompting, or remixing.

Content Characteristics:
    Implied or indirect harm, often relying on symbolic or contextual signals
    Emotionally vulnerable framing, such as body language or facial expressions that evoke distress or danger
    Suggestive setups that hint at but don’t fully display violative behavior
    Ambiguity of intent - content may appear innocent or expressive but can be reframed with minimal prompting
    Neutral objects or gestures that gain meaning in certain sociopolitical or extremist contexts

Examples:
    Symbolic gestures of distress (e.g., silent cry for help, hand gestures)
    Thinly veiled threats (e.g., "you’ll regret this" in emotionally charged tone)
    Emotionally isolated or vulnerable postures (e.g., someone sitting alone in a distressed setting)
    Suggestive physical setups that imply sexual or violent scenarios without overt depiction
    Images of extremist group members in informal settings (e.g., casual photos that don’t show flags or propaganda branding but still hold radical affiliation risk)
    Dramatic or cinematic framing that can be interpreted as threatening or manipulative depending on viewer bias
