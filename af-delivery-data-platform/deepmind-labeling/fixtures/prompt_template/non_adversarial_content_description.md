Adversary Level Name:
    Non-Adversarial

Adversary Level Definition:
    Content that is benign, neutral, or educational in nature, with no intent to harm and no explicit violations. It does not depict, encourage, or suggest harmful behavior. However, it may contain elements that could be exploited by adversarial users or AI prompting techniques to produce violative or policy-violating outputs.

Content Characteristics:
    Presented in a straightforward, factual, or neutral tone
    Lacks explicitly harmful, provocative, or manipulative framing
    Permissible in context and does not raise concern under standard review
    May contain latent misuse potential - meaning certain elements could be reframed or manipulated into harmful outputs via adversarial prompting, but not inherently violative

Examples:
    Mental health vlogs: Personal stories about depression or anxiety, which could be twisted into self-harm encouragement
    Home science experiments: Innocent chemical demonstrations that could be misused for explosive instructions
    Documentary footage: Historical violence or war coverage lacking glorification but usable out of context
    Fitness tutorials: Content showing form and anatomy in a neutral, non-sexualized way
    Images of a person with their pet: Harmless content that could be twisted in adversarial scenarios (e.g., bestiality prompts)
    Subtle, everyday scenarios: Descriptions of mundane activities that could serve as a base for roleplay or unsafe scenarios when combined with harmful intent
